# Project code style

Standard "[PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)" should be used as a code style.

The most important (must read) parts of this convention are:
- [Comments](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#comments)
- [Naming Conventions](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#naming-conventions)

Also, there are some additional rules that should be applied to the project.



# Additional rules

## Docs file names

Every file in `docs/` directory should have an `UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES` names.



``` bash
# Right 

docs/CODE_STYLE.md

```

``` bash
# Wrong

docs/code_style.md

```

## Type hints

## Protected and private class members


# Recomendation

It's strongly recommended to enable appropriate code formatting on save in your IDE.
It will be much easier to follow code style rules.
